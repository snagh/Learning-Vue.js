# Event Handling in Vue.js

This project demonstrates the basics of event handling in Vue.js. It covers how to listen for user interactions, such as clicks and keyboard inputs, and how to respond to them by updating the application's state or performing other actions.

## Key Concepts

- **Event Listeners:** Vue.js allows you to attach event listeners directly to HTML elements using the `v-on` directive (or its shorthand `@`).
- **Event Modifiers:** Modifiers like `.prevent`, `.stop`, and `.once` can be used to modify the behavior of events.
- **Method Handling:** You can define methods in your Vue instance to handle events. These methods can access and modify the component's data.
- **Inline Handling:** Simple event handling can be done directly within the template using inline expressions.
- **Two-Way Binding:** The `v-model` directive provides two-way data binding for form elements, making it easy to update data based on user input.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file and a JavaScript file.

- **index.html:** Contains the basic HTML structure and the Vue.js template.
- **app.js:** Contains the Vue.js application logic, including data, methods, and event handling.

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Interact with the elements on the page to see the event handling in action.

## Examples

The project includes examples of:

- Clicking buttons to update data.
- Listening for keyboard input.
- Using event modifiers.
- Using two-way data binding.
